# LED-Lights

This is Made for Raspberry pi, but for convenience I commented out all lines to do with GPIO as my normal Computer doesn't support GPIO 

This is a project for school. I may of completely overdone it, but why not. I had just learned how to make a gui with Tkinter.

I don't have plans for this, but I want to make it look better.
