# LED-Lights


This is a project for school. I may of completely overdone it, but why not. I had just learned how to make a gui with Tkinter.

I don't have plans for this, but I want to make it look better.


This was Built for Python 3, to run on Python 2 you will need to do a little modifictations, mostly with changing tkinter to Tkinter, maybe more.
