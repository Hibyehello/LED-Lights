# LED-Lights

This is Made for Raspberry pi, but it is set up to run on any computer, although no led lights on a non-Raspberry pi

This is a project for school. I may of completely overdone it, but why not. I had just learned how to make a gui with Tkinter, and I have now learned PyQt.

I don't have plans for this, but I want to make it look better, and to learn python more.
